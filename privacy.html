<div class="section">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Curl it! ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection, usage, and protection in relation to our application, Curl it! (the "App").</p>
    <p>By using Curl it!, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We use your data only as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our App.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>At present, Curl it! does not collect any personal information from its users. We have designed our App with a strong emphasis on user privacy and data minimization. Our current practices include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No collection of personal identifiers such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers</li>
        <li>No collection of device information or IP addresses</li>
        <li>No user accounts or registration required</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We believe that the best way to protect your data is not to collect it in the first place. This approach allows you to use our App with confidence, knowing that your personal information remains private.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>3. Local Storage and Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Curl it! uses local storage on macOS SwiftData for persistent storage. This means:</p>

        <li>No data is transmitted to or stored on our servers</li>
        <li>You have full control over the data stored by the App</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data stored locally may include your preferences and settings within the App. This data is used solely to improve your user experience and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

        <li>We do not sell, rent, or lease any personal information</li>
        <li>We do not disclose any information for marketing or advertising purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the unlikely event that we are required by law to disclose any information, we will do so in accordance with applicable legal requirements and will endeavor to limit the scope of any such disclosure.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
